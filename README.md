#Kickstarter Analysis 
##Overview of Project
This project was created to compare different crowdfunding campaigns to better inform a person who wants to start their own crowdfunding campaign for a play. To do this, we looked at different crowdfunding projects for various categories ranging from film to music to theater, among others. We also used other important data, such as pledged money, country the crowdfunding took place, and the outcome of each campaign, to know how successful each crowdfunding campaign was and use that information to better understand what conditions are needed in order for a crowdfunding campaign to be more likely to be successful. 

##Analysis and Challenges
###Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Dates
In order to have a better understanding of when is the best time of year to launch a crowdfunding campaign, we looked at the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns and the month they were created. With this information, we can have a better idea of when crowdfunding campaigns are more likely to be successful and when they are more likely to fail. Below is the graph we got when looking at the success rates for theater campaigns

As we can see, May, June, and July are the best months to create a campaign to increase the chances of it being successful, with May being the best month of the year. On the other hand, December and October are the worst months of the year to start a campaign as the success-to-fail ratio is really low, with December being the worst having almost 50% of their campaigns failing.

###Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
We wanted to look at the percentage of successful and failed crowdfunding campaigns based on the monetary goal of each campaign to see what goals were more likely to succeed and which ones were more likely to fail. We created 12 ranges starting with campaigns whose goals were less than $1,000 and from there, we incremented each range by $5,000 going all the way up to $50,000 or more as the campaignâ€™s goals. In the graph below, we can see the success and failed range based on the amount of money a campaign set as its goal.
